# Online Academy: Introduction to Artificial Intelligence

Open Source implementation of an online academy to introduce Artificial Intelligence to the public. The online certificate program "Introduction to Artificial Intelligence" is free and will take you approximately 60 hours (6 weeks) to complete. It will shed light on various aspects of AI, including definitions, neural networks, machine learning and societal implications. No programming, but some basic math is required. Some exercises also require you to draw with a pen and paper to find the answer to the question. You will receive a certificate after successfuly completing the course.

## SYLLABUS AND LEARNING OBJECTIVES

The material of the open online course "Introduction to Artificial Intelligence", offered online, consists of text and interactive elements. The material is divided in six chapters which are:

1. What is AI?
2. AI problem solving
3. Real world AI
4. Machine learning
5. Neural networks
6. Implications

After successfully completing the course the student will be able to:

- Identify autonomy and adaptivity as key concepts of AI
- Distinguish between realistic and unrealistic AI (science fiction vs. real life)
- Express the basic philosophical problems related to AI including the implications of the Turing test and Chinese room thought experiment
- Formulate a real-world problem as a search problem
- Formulate a simple game (such as tic-tac-toe) as a game tree
- Use the minimax principle to find optimal moves in a limited-size game tree
- Express probabilities in terms of natural frequencies
- Apply the Bayes rule to infer risks in simple scenarios
- Explain the base-rate fallacy and avoid it by applying Bayesian reasoning
- Explain why machine learning techniques are used
- Distinguish between unsupervised and supervised machine learning scenarios
- Explain the principles of three supervised classification methods: the nearest neighbor method, linear regression, and logistic regression
- Explain what a neural network is and where they are being successfully used
- Understand the technical methods that underpin neural networks
- Understand the difficulty in predicting the future and be able to better evaluate the claims made about AI
- Identify some of the major societal implications of AI including algorithmic bias, AI-generated content, privacy, and work


## Requirements

Webserver, PHP and Oracle MySQL.

## Installation

Copy all php files to a webserver directory of your choice. After installing the SQL script, the database is generated. Adjust the mysql connection settings in the code.
